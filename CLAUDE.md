# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

8PM is an iOS app built with SwiftUI that uses Supabase for backend services. The app appears to be a social accountability platform where users commit to daily tasks/goals and share proof of completion.

## Build and Test Commands

### Building
```bash
# Build the project (requires Xcode)
xcodebuild -project 8PM.xcodeproj -scheme 8PM -configuration Debug

# Or open in Xcode
open 8PM.xcodeproj
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
xcodebuild test -project 8PM.xcodeproj -scheme 8PM -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'

# Run specific test target
xcodebuild test -project 8PM.xcodeproj -scheme 8PM -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -only-testing:8PMTests

# Run UI tests
xcodebuild test -project 8PM.xcodeproj -scheme 8PM -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -only-testing:8PMUITests
```

## Architecture

### Core Structure

The app follows an MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern with feature-based organization:

- **8PM/App/**: Application entry point and root view management
  - `_PMApp.swift`: Main app entry point, initializes Supabase connection
  - `RootView.swift`: Root view that handles authentication state and routing

- **8PM/Core/**: Feature modules organized by domain
  - **Authentication/**: Phone-based authentication flow
    - ViewModels: `AuthViewModel` handles phone verification logic
    - Views: Authentication UI components
  - **Daily/**: Daily task/goal management
  - **Feed/**: Social feed for viewing others' completed tasks
  - **Profile/**: User profile management
  - **Camera/**: Photo capture for task proof

- **8PM/Models/**: Data models matching Supabase schema
  - `User.swift`: User profile model with phone, display name, avatar, bio
  - `Daily.swift`: `DailyThing` model representing a daily commitment with proof tracking (photos, timestamps, completion status)

- **8PM/Services/**: Backend integration layer
  - `SupabaseService.swift`: Singleton service managing Supabase client instance and current user
  - `SupabaseConfig.swift`: Contains Supabase URL and API key (excluded from git)

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Supabase Integration**: All backend operations go through `SupabaseService.shared.client`
2. **@MainActor**: ViewModels and services are marked with `@MainActor` for thread safety with UI updates
3. **Authentication State**: Managed centrally in `RootView` using Supabase auth session
4. **Models**: Mirror Supabase database schema with snake_case to camelCase mapping via `CodingKeys`

### Data Flow

```
View ‚Üí ViewModel (@Published) ‚Üí SupabaseService ‚Üí Supabase Client ‚Üí Backend
                                        ‚Üì
                                  Models (Codable)
```

## Important Notes


## User Flows

### Flow 1: First Time User (Onboarding)

1. Open app ‚Üí Welcome screen
2. Tap "Continue" ‚Üí Phone number entry
3. Enter phone ‚Üí Receive SMS code
4. Enter verification code ‚Üí Account created
5. Create profile (name)
6. 4-screen onboarding tutorial
7. Find friends (optional)
8. Set first daily thing
9. Home screen (empty feed state)

### Flow 2: Daily Morning Routine

1. 9:00 AM notification: "Set your thing for today"
2. Open app ‚Üí "What's your ONE thing today?"
3. Type goal (e.g., "Go for a 20-min run")
4. Tap "Lock It In"
5. Confirmation: "Your thing is set. Do it by 8 PM."
6. Home screen shows: "‚è≥ Waiting for proof..."

### Flow 3: Taking Proof Photo

1. Complete your thing during the day
2. Open app ‚Üí Tap "Take Proof Photo"
3. Grant camera permission (first time only)
4. Dual camera view opens (front + back)
5. Tap capture button ‚Üí Both photos taken
6. Review screen ‚Üí Choose "Retake" or "Use This"
7. If "Use This" ‚Üí Photos locked
8. Confirmation: "üîí Locked & Ready! Posting at 8:00 PM"
9. Home screen shows: "‚úÖ Proof locked"

### Flow 4: 8 PM Drop (Completed)

1. 8:00 PM ‚Üí Auto-post triggered
2. Locked photos upload to server
3. Push notification: "üîî IT'S TIME! Your proof is now live"
4. Open app ‚Üí Feed unlocks
5. See all friends' posts for today
6. React to posts with emojis
7. View profiles, follow new people

### Flow 5: 8 PM Drop (Didn't Complete)

1. 8:00 PM notification: "Did you do it yet?"
2. Open app ‚Üí Prompt: "Did you do it?"
3. Tap "I Didn't üòî"
4. Dual camera opens: "Take a photo of where you are right now"
5. Capture honest photo
6. Optional: Select reason (dropdown)
7. Post marked ‚ùå "Didn't complete"
8. Feed unlocks ‚Üí See friends' posts

### Flow 6: Missed 10 AM Deadline

1. Open app after 10:00 AM (no thing set)
2. Lockout screen: "You missed today's deadline"
3. Message: "Try again tomorrow at 9 AM"
4. Option: "See What Friends Are Doing" (read-only feed)
5. Cannot participate today
6. Marked as "‚è≥ No response" in friends' feeds

### Configuration
- `SupabaseConfig.swift` is gitignored and contains sensitive credentials
- The config requires `url` and `key` static properties
- Target deployment: iOS 18.5+
- Swift version: 5.0

### Dependencies
- **Supabase Swift SDK** (v2.5.1+): Installed via Swift Package Manager
  - Repository: https://github.com/supabase/supabase-swift
  - Used for authentication, database operations, and storage

### Current State
- The on-boarding tutorial is the next step in implementation. This happens once the user signs up for the first time.
- RootView shows placeholder text for authenticated/unauthenticated states
- Core feature modules (Camera, Daily, Feed, Profile) have folder structure but no implementations yet
